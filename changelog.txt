4.6.2-comcast3
** bug fixes - a skip name used to handle provisioning redirects in CAP was accidentally reused from other behavior
**** this has been corrected, the "No (Comcast)" option is no longer offered on retry provisioning when not first-time setup.
**** fixed some incorrect jumps between steps when CAP is interrupted by another issue


4.6.2-comcast2
** Improved handling of Comcast Activation Process
**** Now handles customers calling us while already able to access the provisioning page
**** Continues with Comcast Activation Process steps if provisioning page appears but does not work
 
4.6.1-comcast version: changes in provisioning behavior
** Follows new Comcast Activation Process
** Specifies to use CAP instead of PWT as case flag when applicable
** Advise customer to attempt self-activation when present
** Now includes optional blue theme from later betas (default is Clouds as before)

changes in 4.6
** Fixed typos

changes in 4.5
** Fix for flow no longer checking if first time setup / has been provisioned

changes in 4.4
** You can now specify multiple actions to consider for step skipping in a button.
** Flow restructured to fit clarified requirements and troubleshooting steps 
**** Tries reset first if the send light is flashing
**** If lights are solid, checks for direct connection to modem before performing other troubleshooting
**** If the customer is using a separate modem and can't bypass, both modem and router are powercycled
**** Removed "Are any devices able to access the Internet"
** Some unlikely or "user error" inputs that caused errors or loops have been fixed
** The tool now remembers if a direct connection to the modem was not possible and warns about this before RMA

changes in 4.3
** added option to override height of optional notes field for individual steps (such as ones prompting manual troubleshooting)
** added buttons and skips to flow file to compensate for possibility of lights returning to non-solid state
** changed handling of warranty status slightly in flow
** miscellaneous code cleanup to reduce chances of browser updates changing functionality
** small appearance tweaks

changes in 4.2
** Reset skipping now replaced with generic step skipping. You can remember and skip any type of action now.
**** If another power outlet, checking coax, checking TV service, or reset have been done, they are skipped.

** Added ability to have tables in the comment text style, defined in steps

** Changes to flow to correct omissions, better match desired flow, and facilitate generic step skipping
**** Troubleshooting coax and power are separated from their prior steps to remember the action done.
**** Redundant LED Check forms are now replaced with the first one thanks to this change, flow is now cleaner

** There is now an ALL OFF button for the LED status

** Added ability to skip steps that are "too early". 
**** Example, the step that asks if the customer is online skips itself if it's before step 3 (if no troubleshooting yet done)


Changes in 4.1a
** Changed style for buttons. Old button style still present by selecting alternate "Original" Page Style in browser "View" menu
**** Some other interface tweaks applied as well. Many of these can be reverted by selecting alternate "Original" page style in browser "View" menu.

** Added subtle transition animations for IE10+ and Firefox 16+. These may work in some other browsers as well.
**** Incompatible browsers will simply skip animations.
**** These animations can be disabled in compatible browsers by selecting alternate "No Animation" page style in browser "View" menu.

** Poplink now is part of the "info" button instead of a link for the question text.
**** If both Popmsg and Poplink are specified, the Popmsg will act as an OK/Cancel confirmation box prior to opening the Poplink

** Completely new flow
**** Highlights: Bypassing router only done if it looks to be relevant, initial powercycle is skipped
**************** RMA step now clarified with options for different possibilities, such as OOW/MSO products or additional troubleshooting needed




Changes in 4.0a2
** Fixed reset skip so it does not count resets if a reset was not actually seleted, such as "Unable to reset" or "Already performed"

Changes in 4.0a1
** Updated remaining LED questions to new input table. Testing not yet fully complete.
** If a factory reset is performed during the call already, subsequent factory resets are skipped if they specify a step to which to skip.

   area to enter comments for elaboration on steps taken or explanation
   for the option selected when it is not a perfect fit
**** Opt-out for note field is defined by presence of "NoNotes" in a step.
     This is intended for substeps where formatting may be affected, but
     can also be used in steps that should not have room for deviation.
     See readme or flow for more information

** When clicking a button, agent-entered notes will be appended before the
   response clicked

** BACK button re-enters agent-entered notes when returning to a previous
   step with notes

   START step 

** Cleaned up code a little bit for readability.

** Added/improved comments in code on all files

** Improved readability of Readme file

** Changed the HTML file so IE renders in latest standards supported by 
   browser. This counters the default behavior in some versions to use
   compatibility view on intranet sites when not needed.
**** This ensures behavior is similar across computers on updated IE
     versions

** adjusted layout to allow an adequate size for text input,
   other fine-tuning to layout and appearance.
